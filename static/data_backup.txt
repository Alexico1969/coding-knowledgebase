After AJAX POST request from html file, no update on jinja2 variables

When performing an AJAX request from an html file, using JQuery ($.ajax), type: 'POST', you can't update the website using jinja2's variables ( {{variable-name}} ).

Weird HTML escape codes appearing when using cookies. 054 012

When using cookies, you might see some weird slash-054 or slash-012 escape codes produced by your JS vars. 

Use the .replace() method to fix that: forward slash - back slash - back slash - 054 - forward slash - g
